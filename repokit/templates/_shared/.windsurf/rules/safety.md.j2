# Agent Safety
- Follow AGENTS.md as the canonical instruction source.
{% if db_type != "none" -%}
- Default to read-only role and SELECT-only queries.
- For exploration, always use WHERE + LIMIT and avoid SELECT *.
- Use scratch schemas per session: `scratch_<user>_<branch>`.
- Do not run DROP/DELETE/UPDATE/TRUNCATE unless explicitly approved.
